My BSc project - measurement and control systems of KNE's micro gas turbine.
Originally written by Jan Pleszyński, overwritten and extended by Piotr Klukowski in 2016.

Firstly I want to apologize for using names in my native language – Polish. The reason is that it was a language of my BSc Thesis, which one I enclose to this folder. However abstract is also in English.

I also want to add that in folder I've enclosed additional software like PC application written in C# for control gas turbine. Moreover I add android application for control from smart phone. Android application was developed in appInventor. Currently it has few bugs, it was only used for showtime :-)

If you have questions feel free to ask. I would be happy to explaint something.
