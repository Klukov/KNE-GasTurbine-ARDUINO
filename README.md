# KNE Gas Turbine ARDUINO - my BSc Thesis
My BSc project - measurement and control systems of KNE's micro gas turbine. <br/>
The first version of control and measurement system was written by Jan Pleszyński, overwritten and extended by Piotr Klukowski in 2016.
<br/>
Extensions: auto start creation, remote control application, measurement system extension, bug fix in both controllers, safety procedures added.

Firstly I want to apologize for using names in my native language – Polish. The reason is that it was a language of my BSc Thesis, which one I enclose to this folder. However abstract is also in English.

I also want to add that in folder I've enclosed additional software like PC program written in C# for control gas turbine. Unfortunately source code is lost due to my hard drive crash. Moreover I add android application for control from smart phone. Android application was developed in appInventor. Currently it has few bugs, it was only used for showtime :-)

SOME EXPLANATIONS:
TG_pomiar - controller of the measurement system of the gas turbine;
TG_sterownik - general controller of the gas turbine;

If you have questions feel free to ask. I would be happy to explaint something.
If you want to see how it works, please ask me i will send you links to some videos.
